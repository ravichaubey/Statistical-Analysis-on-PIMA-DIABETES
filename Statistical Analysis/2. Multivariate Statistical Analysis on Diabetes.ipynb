It is an expansion of bivariate data analysis, which considers only two variables in its models. As multivariate models consider more variables, they can examine more complex phenomena and find data patterns that more accurately represent the real world."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\nsns.set_style('darkgrid')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('../input/pima-indians-diabetes-database/diabetes.csv')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**I am conveting Outcome as Diab for Diabetic Patients and Non-Diab for Non Diabetic Patients.
